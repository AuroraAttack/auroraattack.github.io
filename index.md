# Introduction
<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16928"><img alt="Paper thumbnail" align="right" width="100" src="assets/images/First_page.png"></a></p>
- Introduces AURORA, a PDDL-based cyberattack simulation system.

- Integrates LLMs into PDDL for real-world BAS.
  
- Automates construction of a 1,800+ action attack space with over 300 chains.
 
- AURORA generates higher quality attack plans with broader TTP coverage.

# Attack Demos
This repo stores attack demos generated by Aurora, which can be found in the `examples/` folder.
Each folder in `examples/` contains an attach chain, which includes the emulation plan details and attack steps.

## Emulation Plan Details

| Field           | Description       |
|:-------------   |:------------------|
| Adversary Name  | This refers to the name or codename of the attacker being simulated in the exercise. |
| Creation Time   | This indicates the exact date and time when the emulation plan or attack scenario was created. |

## Attack Step

| Field        | Description          |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| uuid  | A unique identifier for the attack step, ensuring that each step can be individually referenced and tracked. |
| name   | A human-readable name for the attack step, which describes what the step aims to achieve or the action being performed. |
| id   | An identifier that may be used within a specific framework or system to reference the attack step. |
| source   | The origin or creator of the attack step, which can indicate whether it was developed internally, derived from a known threat intelligence source, or part of a manual process. |
| supported_platforms   | The operating systems or environments on which the attack step can be executed. |
| tactics   | The high-level goals or phases of the attack that this step supports. |
| technique   | The specific methods or technologies used in the attack step.  |
| description   | A detailed explanation of what the attack step does. |
| executor   | The command, script, or series of actions that need to be executed to carry out the attack step. |
| arguments   | Any parameters or inputs required by the executor to function correctly. |
| preconditions   | The conditions that must be met before the attack step can be successfully executed.  |
| effects   | The outcomes or changes that result from executing the attack step. |

### Attacker Information

| System        | IP Address          | Version          |
|:-------------|:------------------|:------------------|
| kali   | 192.168.56.33 | 2024.1 x64 |
| windows10   | 192.168.56.34 | Enterprise 22H2 |

1. **Kali Attack Platform**: this kali system has already used the `sliver` command to generate implants for both Windows and Linux, which can be directly used for testing.
    - C2 Framework
      - [Metasploit Framework](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploit-framework)
      - [Sliver Framework](https://sliver.sh/)
    - Other tools
      - [atomic-red-team](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team)

Running the `msfconsole` command in the Kali terminal allows you to use the Metasploit framework, and running `sliver` or `sliver-server` enables you to use the Sliver framework.

2. **Windows Attack Platform**: the windows host has undergone the following modifications: the firewall has been disabled, Windows Security has been turned off, the automatic update feature has been deactivated, and VMware Tools has been installed to facilitate moving or copying files between the physical machine and virtual machines.
    - C2 Framework
      - [Metasploit Framework](https://windows.metasploit.com/)
      - [Sliver Framework](https://sliver.sh/)
    - Other tools
      - [atomic-red-team](https://github.com/redcanaryco/atomic-red-team)

The aforementioned tools are located in the `tools` folder on the desktop. Double-clicking `msfconsole.bat` allows you to use the Metasploit framework, and running `sliver-server_windows.exe` in the command line enables you to use the Sliver framework.

### Firewall Information

| System        | IP Address          | Version          |
|:-------------|:------------------|:------------------|
| pfSense   | 192.168.56.100 |    |

### DNS_server Information

| System        | IP Address          | Version          |
|:-------------|:------------------|:------------------|
| Debian   | 192.168.56.100 |    |

### Victim information

| System        | IP Address          | Version          |
|:-------------|:------------------|:------------------|
| Windows10   | 192.168.56.15 | Enterprise 22H2 |
| Ubuntu   | 192.168.56.16 | 22.04 |
| macOS   | 192.168.56.17 | Monterey 12.0 , 21A5304g |

## Scenario Steps
Each `uuid` encompasses an `executor`, within which the `command` parameter specifies the actual attack command that needs to be executed. You should proceed manually through the attack steps in the sequence of the UUIDs.

| Steps        | Description	                  | Executor                 |
