# Aurora-demos

Aurora is a framework that can construct multi-step cyberattacks (attack chains).
With the help of LLM, it makes use of external attack tools and threat intelligence reports.

We are preparing publishing the source code of Aurora.

## ðŸŽ‰ Introduction

<p><a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16928"><img alt="Paper thumbnail" align="right" width="100" src="assets/images/First_page.png"></a></p>

- Introduces AURORA, a PDDL-based cyberattack simulation system.
- Integrates LLMs into PDDL for real-world BAS.
- Automates construction of a 1,800+ action attack space with over 300 chains.
- AURORA generates higher quality attack plans with broader TTP coverage.

Our paper: [From Sands to Mansions: Simulating Full Attack Chain with LLM-Organized Knowledge](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.16928)

## Attack Demos
This repo stores attack demos generated by Aurora, which can be found in the `examples/` folder.
Each folder in `examples/` contains an attach chain, which includes the emulation plan details and attack steps.

### Emulation Plan Details

| Field           | Description       |
|:-------------   |:------------------|
| Adversary Name  | This refers to the name or codename of the attacker being simulated in the exercise. |
| Creation Time   | This indicates the exact date and time when the emulation plan or attack scenario was created. |

### Attack Step
| Field        | Description       |
|:-------------|:------------------|
| uuid  | A unique identifier for the attack step, ensuring that each step can be individually referenced and tracked. |
| name   | A human-readable name for the attack step, which describes what the step aims to achieve or the action being performed. |
| id   | An identifier that may be used within a specific framework or system to reference the attack step. |
| source   | The origin or creator of the attack step, which can indicate whether it was developed internally, derived from a known threat intelligence source, or part of a manual process. |
| supported_platforms   | The operating systems or environments on which the attack step can be executed. |
| tactics   | The high-level goals or phases of the attack that this step supports. |
| technique   | The specific methods or technologies used in the attack step.  |
| description   | A detailed explanation of what the attack step does. |
| executor   | The command, script, or series of actions that need to be executed to carry out the attack step. |
| arguments   | Any parameters or inputs required by the executor to function correctly. |
| preconditions   | The conditions that must be met before the attack step can be successfully executed.  |
| effects   | The outcomes or changes that result from executing the attack step. |

### There's a horizontal rule below this.

* * *

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

Long, single-line code blocks should not wrap. They should horizontally scroll if they are too long. This line should be long enough to demonstrate this.
